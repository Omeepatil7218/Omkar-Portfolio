I created a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Photoshop. 
On the website, users can toggle between dark and light modes by clicking on either a moon or a sun icon. 
To navigate between the home page and the About page, users can click on the logo on the About page to return to the home page, and click on 'About' on the home page to visit the About page.
Below is the link for the Portfolio..
